# Shared
This is a collection of shared modules and resources for other Dojo applications. It should be included
as a submodule to all Dojo app repositories. It's recommended to keep it pointed to the public canonical
Hacker Dojo repo as a directory called "shared" at the root of your project directory. Like so:

    [submodule "hd-shared"]
        path = shared
        url = git://github.com/hackerdojo/hd-shared.git
